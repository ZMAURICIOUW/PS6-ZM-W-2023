PS6 Repo (Shiny apps)

This is a web app that helps describe my data. My data specifically defines movie data for different streaming platforms based on their age ratings, Rotten Tomatoes ratings, and year, starting from the earliest year of 1914 to the latest year of 2021. There are 3 tabs: One generalized tab with information on the dataset, one plot tab that shows a histogram with 2 widgets (a dropdown menu that allows one to change which streaming service's data they are viewing and a radio button widget that changes the color of the bars), and one table tab that has a checkbox widget controlling what columns of data are available for viewing. Both the plot and the table have descriptive text entries underneath each of them that describe what the plot and table are showing in greater detail.
